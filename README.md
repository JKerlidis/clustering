# Clustering Algorithms
Implementation of various clustering algorithms in Java. The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate a "proof of concept" of all of these algorithms from first principles, rather than providing efficiency and generalised usability across contexts.

Implementation of the k-means algorithm is complete. Work on a Gaussian Mixture Modelling algorithm is currently a work in progress.
